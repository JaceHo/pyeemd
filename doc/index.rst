Welcome to pyeemd's documentation!
==================================

This is the documentation of `pyeemd`, which is a Python wrapper for `libeemd`,
a C library for performing the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD),
its complete variant (CEEMDAN) or the regular empirical mode decomposition
(EMD).

If you have any questions or problems with `pyeemd`, or you wish to
propose enhancements, please check out the `main project website`_.

This article also describes in detail what libeemd actually
computes. You should definitely read it if you are unsure about what EMD, EEMD
and CEEMDAN are.
